If you opt to guess and get the answer 'Bagels' it means none of the digits are in the number. 'Fermi' means one of the digits is right and is in the right place. 'Pico' means that it's in the number but the wrong place. The other cases are just combinations of these. To win, guess the number in less than 7 guesses. The computer is dumb and does not have a limited number of guesses. If you opt to choose, say 'Pico' or 'Fermi' or 'Bagels' or its combinations with spaces in between.\
